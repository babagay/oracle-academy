Sanaa, Yemen (CNN)The governor of Aden, Yemen, was killed along with five bodyguards when a car bomb detonated Sunday morning, local officials said.

Gov. Jaafar Saad was visiting a branch of the Ministry of Telecommunication in the southern port city when the blast occurred, the officials said. They initially said a suicide bomber drove an explosives-laden vehicle into Saad's car, but later said the blast was the result of a car bomb.

Aden has been functioning as the de facto capital of the government of Saudi-backed President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi.

Hadi was ousted from the capital in March by Shiite Houthi rebels.

There has been no claim of responsibility for the attack. Parts of Aden are under the control of al-Qaeda.


Its tires ruptured after takeoff, forcing it to land at Tunica Airport in Mississippi, attorney William Luckett said.

The plane skid off the runway as it landed, damaging it further, according to Luckett, who is also the mayor of Clarksdale.

Another aircraft was scheduled to pick Morgan up and take him to Houston.

A law enforcement source said authorities received a 911 call following the incident. Two people were aboard the plane, but no injuries were reported, the source said.

The Oscar-winning actor is known for his authoritative voice and calm demeanor.

He has appeared in various movies, including "Million Dollar Baby," "The Shawshank Redemption" and "Invictus."

Story highlights

    "We're holding you accountable for your lack of action," Xiuhtezcatl Tonatiuh says
    "I wanna see concrete action and concrete promises from our country -- and commitments for action on climate change"

"CNN Opinion columnist John D. Sutter is reporting on a tiny number -- 2 degrees -- that may have a huge effect on the future. He'd like your help. Tell him how climate change could affect you personally, and you could be part of CNN's coverage.

You can also subscribe to the "2 degrees" newsletter or follow him on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. He's jdsutter on Snapchat. You can shape this coverage."

Paris (CNN)Xiuhtezcatl Tonatiuh became a climate change activist at age 6 when he saw an environmental documentary. He asked his mom to find a way for him to speak at a rally.

    Met this guy the other day in Paris. Now 15 and suing the Obama Administration over climate change. https://t.co/Efi76f60GP #2degrees
    — John D. Sutter (@jdsutter) November 30, 2015

Now 15, the long-haired, hip-hop-savvy Coloradan is one of 21 young activists joining climate scientist James Hansen in suing the Obama administration for failing to ditch fossil fuels.

"It's basically a bunch of kids saying you're not doing your job," he told me here at the U.N. COP21 climate change summit in Paris.

"You're failing, you know. F-minus. We're holding you accountable for your lack of action."

I'm not sure what will become of his lawsuit (although it's clear the fossil fuel industry feels threatened by it; it's apparently trying to get the legal action dismissed), but Tonatiuh's voice is an essential one as more than 140 world leaders and thousands of policy wonks and journalists convene here for the most important climate change summit in history.

He's part of the "generation with the most to lose," he told me.
Obama: Nothing will deter us

Obama: Nothing will deter us 04:15

On Monday, after the climate summit opened with a bizarre version of the green-carpet Oscars, with presidents crawling out of fancy cars and looking for photo-ops (why weren't any of them riding bikes!? I would have loved that), U.S. President Barack Obama, a defendant in the 15-year-old's lawsuit, gave one of the most anticipated speeches of the summit.

"I've come here personally, as the leader of the world's largest economy and the second-largest emitter, to say that the United States of America not only recognizes our role in creating this problem, we embrace our responsibility to do something about it," Obama said.

"Over the last seven years, we've made ambitious investments in clean energy and ambitious reductions in our carbon emissions. We've multiplied wind power threefold, and solar power more than twentyfold, helping create parts of America where these clean power sources are finally cheaper than dirtier, conventional power. We've invested in energy efficiency in every way imaginable. We've said no to infrastructure that would pull high-carbon fossil fuels from the ground, and we've said yes to the first-ever set of national standards limiting the amount of carbon pollution our power plants can release into the sky."

Obama also was expected to join billionaire Bill Gates in announcing an international group of investors and governments to fund development of clean-energy technologies.

I see that as a very encouraging development. (And I got to ask Gates one of the questions you guys sent via Snapchat ... look for more on that soon.)

But Tonatiuh, who I met over the weekend, more or less predicted what Obama would say. As an 8-year-old (this kid is the Doogie Howser of climate activism, I swear, and, yes, I know that '80s TV reference is dating me) he campaigned for Obama. But he's getting antsy in his mid-teens. He knows the Obama administration has pushed to make vehicles more efficient and clean up coal-fired power plants. He's seen the country's climate pact with China, with the world's two largest polluters pledging -- and this would have been unheard of not many years ago -- to slow and reverse their emissions of global warming gasses.

But he also knows it's not enough to meet the world's goal of limiting warming to 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels. To do that, we need to ditch fossil fuels completely.

Obama has "said it before, that climate change is one of the most pressing issues of our time," Tonatiuh told me. "That, in his lifetime, he wants to see the slowing of the rising seas. We've all seen that speech. Talk is cheap. I wanna see concrete action and concrete promises from our country -- and commitments for action on climate change."

He's only 15, mind you.

But he's already thinking about his kids.

"The reason we are fighting for this is because of the world we want to grow up in, and the world we want our children and grandchildren and great-grandchildren to grow up in," he said. "This is not a selfish cause. We're not politically invested, we're not financially invested. ... We are in this because of the way it affects the state of the planet we want to be left with. That is the most noble cause I'd say: Leaving our children a better planet than the one we are living in today. We are doing our part. We need political leaders to step up and do theirs."

The first day of the COP21 summit was filled with lots of what Tonatiuh, and many other activists, are sick of: talk. "We have the knowledge, the tools and the money -- only 1.7% of global annual consumption would be required to put us on the right low carbon path for 2030," said the UK's Prince Charles. "The science is clear," said U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. "Even a 2-degree rise will have serious consequences for food and water security, economic stability and international peace. That is why we need a universal, meaningful agreement here in Paris."

We absolutely need that agreement.

And discussion must precede it, of course.

I'm optimistic these talks will succeed where so many have failed. (The reason the summit is called COP21 is this is the 21st time we've done this.) But I'm so glad that, despite the Paris ban on mass demonstrations following the November 13 terror attacks, smart young people like Tonatiuh, who is a hip-hop artist and activist inspired by Aztec traditions, are here to lend their voices to the process.

"Let there be no doubt," Obama said Monday, "the next generation is watching what we do. ... I want our actions to show that we're listening."

"For I believe, in the words of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.," he continued, "that there is such a thing as being too late. And when it comes to climate change, that hour is almost upon us."

No one realizes that more than young people like Tonatiuh.

Those of us beyond our teens must listen and then look inward.

Are our actions enough that we can say to future generations: We did everything we could to slow this steamrolling crisis -- to save countries like the Marshall Islands from rising seas; to prevent unnecessary heat waves, droughts and wildfires; to make sure millions don't fall into poverty and watch their crops fail because of our greed?

If not, what does that say about us?

Can we please get rid of the phrase 'It's good for the environment'.  No, a Prius is not good for the environment, no, being vegan is not good for the environment, and no, bringing and washing your own utensils to restaurants that serve plastic ones is not good for the environment.  It's simply less bad.

Makes sense! Let's just do away with all fossil fuels today! It should be fun watching the climate change liberals try and voice their opinion about global warming without their cell phone (made primarily of plastic which comes from fossil fuels), without their computers (also made primarily of plastic), without electricity (coal fired electric plants provide 67% of electricity in the US)...and obviously they can't drive to somewhere to protest since their will be no gasoline for cars, rubber for ties or plastic for various components of cars. Yeah, makes total sense to just do away with fossil fuels...

Sue the GOP dude. They are the ones blocking all the climate change legislation. It does not good to complain to the people trying to make change. You need to win over the people who won't even say it's happening. Suing someone who supports your cause is not very smart in my book. James Inhofe should be his first contact. You can explain how it can snow when the earth is warming.

The true scientific debate is not about whether CO2 causes some warming. Rather, the debate is about how much warming it will cause.

@victor879 That is true. The correlation between CO2 and other greenhouse gases (like methane which causes much greater warming than CO2) is well understood, and the mechanism that creates warming is well understood. However, it is an extremely complex system and the models developed to accurately predict how much warming will occur are a work in progress. What we can surmise with fairly high level of confidence is that the atmospheric concentration of various greenhouse gases has risen very rapidly since the industrial revolution, and has increased by a degree in the last 200 years that is far greater than any previously measured increase over the past several thousand years.


Scientists can model with great accuracy the temperature cycles that have occurred due to variations in the earth's orbit and tilt, which has been responsible for past ice ages and warming cycles, and that is an insignificant factor over the last 200 years. The scientific facts are:


1. Global greenhouse gas concentrations have increases more in the last 200 years than any previous measured data;

2. Temperatures have risen more in the last 200 years than any other comparable time period in the measured data;

3. Natural global temperature cycles take thousands of years to create the same magnitude of temperature change that has been measured in the last 200 years;

4. The earth's population has multiplied 7-fold in the last 200 years;

5. Global energy output and greenhouse gas emissions have risen faster in the last 200 years than ever before over million years.

A logical conclusion from the above data is that mankind has had a significant influence on the generation of thermal energy and greenhouse gases, which have been proven to lead to increased global temperatures.
